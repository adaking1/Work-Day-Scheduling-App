# Work-Day-Scheduling-App


## Link


## Description

This website was created to help any busy worker keep track of all the tasks needed to be done in a day. 


## Usage

Input to-do items in the time-boxes and press save. These tasks will be saved in local storage and rendered to the same spot when the page is reloaded. The time-boxes will be green for future hours, red for the current hour, and grey for past hours. At the start of each day when the page is loaded, the local storage will be cleared so you can start your day with an empty calendar, ready to use.
